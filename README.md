 EDUVISION-KE

EDUVISION-KE- is an AI-powered early-warning, talent discovery, and decision-support system designed to support Kenya’s Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) through predictive, inclusive, and secure digital intelligence.

Problem Statement
Kenya’s education ecosystem lacks timely, data-driven mechanisms to identify learner risk early, uncover hidden talent beyond examinations, and support equitable, evidence-based decision-making. Many learners drop out, underperform, or remain undiscovered due to late interventions and fragmented data systems.

Solution Overview
EDUVISION-KE applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze educational signals such as performance trends, attendance patterns, behavioural indicators, and contextual risks. The system generates early warnings for at-risk learners while simultaneously identifying strengths across academic, creative, technical, and vocational domains.

 Key Features
- Early-warning risk prediction using AI
- Talent discovery aligned with CBC competencies
- Inclusive support for learners with disabilities
- Multilingual and accessible design
- Secure, privacy-by-design architecture
- Decision dashboards for schools and policymakers

Security & Privacy
The platform applies data minimization, pseudonymization, role-based access control, and cryptographic protection for data at rest and in transit, ensuring compliance with Kenyan data protection laws.
